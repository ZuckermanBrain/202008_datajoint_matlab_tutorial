# Columbia workshop August 2020, for DataJoint Matlab

The materials include:

* Session 1 demo: Build a pipeline from scratch, query and fetch data from the pipeline
* Session 2 demo: Imported table and computed table
* Session 3 demo: Common design patterns and advanced queries

The materials are interactive, which requires users to insert code. The folder `completed_sessions` contains a complete version of the scripts

To run the packages yourself, you will need to install DataJoint matlab and have access to a database server. 

To install DJ matlab:

1. Click Add-Ons on Matlab homepage.
2. Select Get Add-Ons
3. Search for datajoint
4. Click on DataJoint icon
5. Click install from GitHub 


For the database server, there are three options:

1. Use the u19 sandbox server s1n4.u19motor.zi.columbia.edu if you already have access.
2. Use the tutorial database hosted by DataJoint Neuro, tutorial-db.datajoint.io, register on datajoint.io to obtain credentials
3. Set up a mariadb instance on your local machine if you know how to.
